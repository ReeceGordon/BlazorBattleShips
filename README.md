# BlazorBattleShips
 
A small web application made to test the waters with .Net Blazor WebAssembly that allows one player to play a one side game of Battleships. Three battleships spawn on a 100 tile grid at random locations ensuring to never overlap with each other. Coordinates are entered to specifiy a tile to attack, shots result in hitting the tile and displaying such. The game ends when all battleships are successfully hit.

Since this is a Blazor project it uses an emerging technology WebAssembly, it should be compatable with all modern browers, please refer here for a full list of compatability: https://webassembly.org/roadmap/
